    <h2>Playing Volleyball</h2>
    <p>
      Volleyball has been a huge part of my life. I love the energy, teamwork, and strategy involved. Whether it’s
      digging out a tough serve or delivering a powerful spike, being on the court keeps me focused and motivated.

    <h2>Coaching Volleyball</h2>
    <p>
      Coaching has given me a deeper understanding of the game. I enjoy teaching players the fundamentals, building team
      chemistry, and helping them grow. It’s rewarding to watch athletes build confidence and improve their skills.

    <h2>Why Volleyball Matters to Me</h2>
    <p>
      Volleyball is more than a sport — it’s a lifelong passion. It’s helped shape who I am as a leader and teammate.
      Both playing and coaching have taught me resilience, discipline, and the importance of trust.

    <h2>My Passion for Gundam</h2>
    <p>
      Outside of volleyball, I’m a huge fan of Gundam. Building Gundam is one of my favorite things to
      do to relax — it's a creative and calming way to unwind after a long day.
